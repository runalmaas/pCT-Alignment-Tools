# pCT-Alignment-Tools

A collection of all tools used to analyze alignment data for the pCT-alignment prototype module.


Most of the scripts are at this point useless, but where used to debug and fix
 issues during development of the prototype.

Some tools can also be found in the gitlab pCT-Online repo.
